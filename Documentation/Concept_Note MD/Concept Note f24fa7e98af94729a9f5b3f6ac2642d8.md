# Concept Note

# Goal :

To analyze DRINKING WATER  and SANITATION using correlation.

To identify 

- [ ]  Key challenges and
- [ ]  Propose ACTIONABLE SOLUTIONS aligned with
- [ ]  SDG goal 6 :”CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION”

Identify TRENDS, KEY ISSUES and propose DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS

# Objectives of the project

- [ ]  To collect and analyze data on “water and sanitation access”
- [ ]  To identify the “primary factors” contributing to ‘Lack of access to clean water’ and ‘sanitation’
- [ ]  To understand TEMPORAL(changes or patterns that occur over time) and SPATIAL(changes or patterns that occur across different locations or ‘regions’) eg- Regional patterns such as differences between URBAN and RURAL areas / between different regions or COUNTRIES
- [ ]  To develop PREDICTIVE MODELS for future access based on “current data”
- [ ]  To propose actionable solutions  and policy recommendations  to enhance ‘access to clean water and sanitation’
- This is happening due to this, so we should do this(CAUSE-SOLUTION)
- [ ]  To asses the potential impact of these “solutions” on achieving SGD goal 6
- How its gonna impact, increase rate of success (by our solutions)
- How its aligned/ connected with SDG 6

2. **Access levels :** Proportion of population with access to “Safely managed drinking water” and “ sanitation”
3. **Time :** Temporal data including year of recordings (Year)
4. **Demographics :** (Population) density, (Urban) vs (Rural) population, and socioeconomic status (poor, rich, richest)*
