Here is a summary of the key facts and figures from the document "(Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000-2020- Five years into the SDGs)":

### Introduction

- **Objective**: The report aims to provide internationally comparable estimates of progress on drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as monitored by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (JMP). It assesses the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets 6.1 and 6.2 from 2000 to 2020.

### Highlights

- **Global Coverage (2015-2020)**:
    - **Drinking Water**:
        - 74% of the global population had access to safely managed drinking water services.
        - Achieving universal access by 2030 requires quadrupling current progress rates.
    - **Sanitation**:
        - 54% had access to safely managed sanitation services.
        - A 4x increase in progress rates is needed to achieve universal coverage by 2030.
    - **Hygiene**:
        - 71% had basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home.
        - 2.3 billion people lacked basic services, including 670 million with no handwashing facilities at all.
        - Universal access requires a 4x increase in progress rates.

### Problem Identification

- **Problem Statement**: The world is not on track to achieve SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 by 2030. Significant acceleration in progress is required, especially in least developed countries (LDCs) and fragile contexts.
- **Significance of the Problem**:
    - LDCs and fragile contexts face the greatest challenges in achieving WASH targets.
    - Extending services to rural areas and vulnerable populations is particularly difficult.

### Data Collection

- **Sources of Data**: The data is collected and monitored by the WHO/UNICEF JMP, which includes surveys and assessments from various countries.

### Data Analysis

- **Key Findings**:
    - **Drinking Water**: 47% of the global population had access to safely managed drinking water services in 2020, up from 28% in 2000.
    - **Sanitation**: 54% of the global population had access to safely managed sanitation services in 2020, up from 28% in 2000.
    - **Hygiene**: 71% had basic handwashing facilities in 2020, but significant disparities exist, particularly in LDCs and fragile contexts.

### Solution Design

- **Proposed Solutions**: Accelerating progress through increased investment, targeted policies, and innovative solutions tailored to local contexts.

- **Implementation Plan**: Focus on improving infrastructure, increasing funding, and enhancing community engagement.

- **Alignment with SDGs**: Directly addresses SDG 6 targets, contributing to overall health, education, and economic outcomes.

### Visualization

- **Data Visualization Techniques**: Use of charts, graphs, and maps to illustrate progress and disparities.
- **Key Visual Insights**: Highlighting regions with the most significant gaps and the progress needed to achieve universal coverage.

### Conclusion

- **Summary of Findings**: Significant progress has been made in WASH services, but the current rate is insufficient to meet SDG targets by 2030.
- **Impact of Proposed Solutions**: Accelerating progress can ensure sustainable and equitable access to WASH services, improving overall health and well-being.
- **Future Work**: Continued monitoring, increased investment, and adaptive strategies to address emerging challenges and disparities.

### Summary Report: Clean Water and Sanitation Analysis

**Introduction:**
This report analyzes drinking water and sanitation data to identify key challenges and propose actionable solutions aligned with SDG Goal 6: "Clean Water and Sanitation." The analysis includes data on drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene from 2000 to 2022 across different global regions.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Service Levels:**
    - **Basic Service:** Drinking water from an improved source within a 30-minute round trip.
    - **Limited Service:** Drinking water from an improved source exceeding a 30-minute round trip.
    - **Safely Managed Service:** Improved water source on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination.
    - **Unimproved Service:** Water from an unimproved source.
    - **Surface Water:** Drinking water from rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.
    - **Open Defecation:** Defecating in open areas.
2. **Regional Analysis:**
    - Regions include Australia and New Zealand, Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern Africa and Western Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
    - Analysis covers 23 years (2000-2022).
3. **Challenges Identified:**
    - High correlation between limited water access and use of unimproved sanitation facilities.
    - Significant association between limited sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices.
    - High prevalence of open defecation in regions with limited hygiene.
    - Strong link between use of surface water and unimproved sanitation facilities.
    - Lack of proper handwashing facilities in areas with poor sanitation.
4. **Statistical Correlations:**
    - Limited Water & Limited Sanitation: 0.89
    - Limited Sanitation & Limited Hygiene: 0.85
    - Limited Hygiene & Open Defecation: 0.87
    - Surface Water & Unimproved Sanitation: 0.90
    - Unimproved Sanitation & No Handwashing Facility: 0.80

**Data Visualization:**

- **Progress Over the Years:** Trends in surface water usage, basic services, limited services, unimproved services, and safely managed services from 2000-2022 by region.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Means and medians of different water services by year.
- **Sanitation and Hygiene Practices:** Analysis and visualization of sanitation and hygiene practices.

**Conclusion:**

- Identifying and addressing the challenges related to water and sanitation services can significantly improve public health and hygiene practices.
- Focused efforts are required to improve water quality, reduce the time to collect water, and enhance sanitation facilities to meet SDG 6 by 2030.

**Future Work:**

- Further analysis on the impact of improved water and sanitation services on health outcomes.
- Implementation of targeted interventions in regions with the poorest services.

**References:**

- Data sources include the WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, various censuses, household surveys, and administrative data collected from multiple regions over 23 years.
